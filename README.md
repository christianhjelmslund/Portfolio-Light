# Portfolio-Light

*UNDER DEVELOPMENT*: 
The idea of Portfolio Light is to have a very lightweight asset (stocks, crypto) etc. portfolio. You can add your assets, provide the time of when they were bought and everytime you open the app, you would be able to see the profit or loss of the assets. It should be seen as a fun and aesthetically pleasing gimmick to monitor your assets, no more, no less.

The app uses the Alpha Vantage API and to run the app, you need to open the project and provide the file called Constants with your own API key, which can be generated through this link: https://www.alphavantage.co/support/#api-key

The in-app charts are generated with the Charts library: https://github.com/danielgindi/Charts/
